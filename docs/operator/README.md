# Operator

This section contains information for `drand` node operators - the people deploying and maintaining `drand` networks.
For information about consuming the randomness from a `drand` network, see the [Developer's Guide](/developer/) instead.

The following guides are available:

- A [deployment guide](/operator/deploy/) that shows how to set up a drand network and perform necessary maintenance.
- A [metrics guide](/operator/metrics/) that shows how to monitor a running network.
